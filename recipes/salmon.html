    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p> This salmon recipe is quick, beginner friendly, and delicious. This particular recipe serves four
        people, so you can show off your baking skills to your friends and family. 
        This is a personal favorite of mine as it is the first meal I made which I was truly proud of.
        From the satisfying texture of flaky salmon to the lemony garlic sauce, if you follow all the steps, you too can make a meal you are proud of. 
        The end result will be a perfectly baked salmon paired wonderfully with a lemon garnish.
